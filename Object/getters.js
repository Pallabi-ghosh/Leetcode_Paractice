/* Getters are methods that get and return the internal properties of an object. But they can do more than just retrieve the value of a property! 
We use the get keyword followed by a function.
Getters can perform an action on the data when getting a property.
Getters can return different values using conditionals.
In a getter, we can access the properties of the calling object using this.
The functionality of our code is easier for other developers to understand. */

//2. Inside the getter method, add an if statement to check if this._energyLevel is a number using the typeof operator. If that condition is truthy, return 'My current energy level is ENERGYLEVEL'. Replace ENERGYLEVEL with the value of this._energyLevel.
//Make sure you return the string and not logging it to the console.
const robot = {
  _model: "1E78V2",
  _energyLevel: 100,
  get energyLevel() {
    if (typeof this._energyLevel === "number") {
      return "My current energy level is " + this._energyLevel;
    } else {
      return "System malfunction: cannot retrieve energy level";
    }
  },
};

console.log(robot.energyLevel);
